## Getting started

Prerequisites: To run the react-native project on your mobile or emulator you need some
more specific settings, I recommend this link
(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) if you do not already have the recommended settings on your machine.

1. Install
   [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) e
   [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/),
   in case you don't have them yet.

2. Clone repository:

   ```sh
   $ git clone git://github.com/hyankelwin/MarvelHero.git
   ```

3. Go to project folder:

   ```sh
   $ cd marvel
   ```
